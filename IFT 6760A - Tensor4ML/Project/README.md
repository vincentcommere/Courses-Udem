# Exploration with Multi-Scale Tensor Networks

We implemented in pytorch and played with the procedure described in [Stoudenmire 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aaba1a/meta) to build a tree of hierarchical features from images using tensor factorization techniques.

* The procedure described in the paper is summarizd and written in mathematical form [here](https://github.com/AdelNabli/Courses-Udem/blob/master/IFT%206760A%20-%20Tensor4ML/Project/detailed_procedure_stoudenmire.pdf)
* The report for the project is [here](https://github.com/AdelNabli/Courses-Udem/blob/master/IFT%206760A%20-%20Tensor4ML/Project/IFT6760_project_report.pdf)
